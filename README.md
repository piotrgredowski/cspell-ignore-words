# cspell-ignore-words
Generator of ignored words for your project, to be used with cSpell.

## Idea

Idea is to have it as a pre-commit hook which will analyse dependencies in your project and add them to ignore words of cSpell.\

I had also idea to just put all of the i.e. pypi packages as ignored words... But it's more than 1MB...
